# My Stuff

Just a repository that I'll put my learnings, things that I like and more.

## Description

It is a monorepo that I wanna create some blog posts for topics related software engeenering. My knowledges will stay here,
and all of kind of things that I'm learning at the moment. I hope that this content can help some people like me that love tecnology.

## Who am I?

Well, I'm a guy with 30.....31 years old and work like a Senior Software Engineering Backend in Brazil.
I'm married, dog dad, soccer fanatic (my heart team is PALMEIRAS), I've building some things with PHP,
golang, C# .NET, Java and Node etc.
At the moment I've 7 years old of career, first about all, my journey started with PHP, creating an app that uses Lavel for a school system.
It was able to made some CRUDs, for creating students, lessons, billing history, anual progress reports, autentication and autorization systems and more,
maybe one of this blog posts could be a refactor of this system :thinking:.
After that I'm put inside of .net world, changing some legacy systems with full framework to .net core 3, yes the starts of this beautful framework.
And more and more legacy systems in .net migrating it for .Net Core systems, some of kind angularJS legacys for newers angular and more and more legacies in .net to golang.
So my career at now have a lot of things to recreate and thinking about scale, performance and good practices.
For some of you this is too newer and short history, but I hope that I can help some of you.

## Why github?

I like this platform and use it for versioning my code and related knowledge. This will tell a history some day, and all of commits that I made here will remind me for something or help someone.

## Why in english?

I've a wish to learn english well, so like the code and the rest, the best way to learn is put it in practice.

## And....

```shell
git commit -m "init"
```
